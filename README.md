This repository demonstrates a common error in Hack code involving stack overflow in recursive functions. The `foo` function calculates the factorial using recursion.  When a large value is passed as input (like 10000), the program crashes due to exceeding the maximum recursion depth. The solution demonstrates how to prevent the overflow by implementing an iterative approach or by setting a recursion depth limit.
